**TL;DR:** Read [The Bitcoin Standard][bitcoin-standard] and [The Bullish
Case for Bitcoin][bullish-case].

---

## Essentials

I encourage everyone to start at the beginning, and read -- or at least skim --
the 8 pages which gave birth to Bitcoin:

- [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System][bitcoin-whitepaper] by Satoshi Nakamoto

To get a grasp on Bitcoin you will have to read a book or two.  If you only want
to read one book, you can't do wrong with Saifedean's **[The Bitcoin
Standard][the-bitcoin-standard]**. Bitcoin is money, so understanding [The
Ethics of Money Production][the-ethics-of-money-production] is paramount to
understanding what Bitcoin is about. If you need a crash-course in economics I
recommend reading [Economics in One Lesson][economics-in-one-lesson] by Henry
Hazlitt. All three books are also available as audiobooks.

[economics-in-one-lesson]: {{ '/books/economics-in-one-lesson' | absolute_url }}
[the-bitcoin-standard]: {{ '/books/the-bitcoin-standard' | absolute_url }}
[the-ethics-of-money-production]: {{ '/books/the-ethics-of-money-production' | absolute_url }}

{% include books.html category='essentials' %}

If you prefer a shorter introduction, I recommend you read and listen to the
following:

- [The Bullish Case for Bitcoin][bullish-case] by Vijay Boyapati ([audio
version][bullish-case-audio])
- [The Stories We Tell About Money][aantonop-stories] by Andreas Antonopoulos

## Books

Books about Bitcoin which can be read by anyone, no special background knowledge
or education required. As mentioned above, I consider [The Bitcoin
Standard][the-bitcoin-standard] required reading for anyone interested in
Bitcoin.

## Articles

Many amazing articles have been written about Bitcoin. I am aware that trying to
link to all of them is futile, but I want to make an effort and at least
highlight some of them. I highly recommend the [literature listed][sni] at the
Nakamoto Institute and the selection of [articles read][guy-episodes] by
Guy Swann.

One of the best articles to read if you are new to Bitcoin is [The Bullish Case
for Bitcoin][bullish-case], which outlines why there are very good reasons to be
optimistic about Bitcoin's future.

## Podcasts

One of the best ways to educate yourself on Bitcoin is by listening to the
smartest people in the space. Luckily, we are living in the golden age of
podcasts, and many great conversations are "open source" so to speak.
[Disclosure][interviews]: I was a guest on some of these podcasts.

I consider the following podcasts the best in the space:

and principles.
