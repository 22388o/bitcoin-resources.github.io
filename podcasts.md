The list of podcasts is roughly grouped into
[beginner](#beginner),
[intermediate](#intermediate), and
[advanced](#advanced).
There is also a "[specialized](#specialized)" category for podcasts that
focus on one narrow aspect of Bitcoin, and an [archive](#archive) for inactive shows.

Below the podcast list you can find a curated list of [selected podcast
episodes](#selected-podcast-episodes) and [noteworthy podcast
series](#noteworthy-podcast-series).

### Beginner

{% include podcasts.html level="Beginner" %}

### Intermediate

{% include podcasts.html level="Intermediate" %}

### Advanced

### Specialized

As Bitcoin grows, more specialization is to be expected. The following podcasts
focus on one specific aspect of Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network or
mining.

#### Selected Podcast Episodes

Some "evergreen" episodes were recorded in the last couple of years. Again, this
is a personal selection so it is biased towards certain guests and topics.

I am still in the process of going through the archives, so this list will
probably grow over time. If there is an episode missing that you consider
one of the best, feel free to [reach out to me][contact] and shill me said
