# The Remnant Archives

Welcome, remnant. There are two options why you ended up here. You are either
insanely curious, or someone sent you.

In any case, welcome. Below are some links to resources that might be helpful
for you. They were definitely helpful for me.  It took me a while to understand
that we don't necessarily need the masses. But we do need you, the remnant.

## Required Reading

* [Isaiah's Job](https://mises.org/library/isaiahs-job) by Albert Jay Nock

## Podcast Episodes

* [Francis, John, and Aleks](https://youtu.be/8t_sQ4rTGho) on the Bitcoin Remnant
* [Hass McCook](https://pca.st/podcast/2c390830-ee9d-0138-e808-0acc26574db2) preaching to the True Believer

## Talks

* [Citadel Theory: What is coming and how to survive it](https://untappedgrowth.com/citadel-theory-what-is-coming-and-how-to-survive-it/) by Joel from Untapped Growth

## People to Follow

I will not make a list of people. Lists are dangerous. You will find others if you know where to look.
